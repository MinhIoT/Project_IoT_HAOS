# Project_IoT_HAOS
This project focuses on building an IoT gateway based on Home Assistant OS with integrated AI for image processing
The system combines IoT device management, real-time communication, and computer vision to enhance smart monitoring and automation capabilities.
The gateway is designed to receive data from IoT devices (such as ESP32-based cameras and sensors), process visual data using AI models, and provide intelligent responses such as detection, tracking, and notifications.
